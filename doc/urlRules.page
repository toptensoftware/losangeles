# URL Rules

In addition to the page server features, Los Angeles includes a simple URL rewrite,
redirect and proxy feature.

## Setup

To setup the URL mapping use the `urlRules()` method of the Los Angeles component which 
returns an Express middleware:

~~~javascript
// Load LosAngeles
const la  = require('@toptensoftware/losangeles');

// Run redirect rules
app.use(la.urlRules([
    // redirect rules go here (see below)
]));
~~~

## Configuring Rules

The `urlRules()`  method expects an array of rules that should be processed.

Each entry in the array is a JavaScript object with either a `redirect`, `rewrite`
or `proxy` field declaring a regular expression to match against the URL and a `to` 
property specifying where the URL should be remapped:

~~~javascript
[
    // Redirect
    { 
        redirect: /^\/downloads\/(.*)$/i, 
        to: "http://static.mysite.com/$1" 
    },

    // Rewrite 
    { 
        rewrite: /^\/downloads\/(.*)$/i, 
        to: "/newblog/$1" 
    },

    // proxy
    { 
        proxy: /^\/myproduct\/releasenotes.json/i, 
        to: "http://static.mysite.com/myproduct-releaseNotes.json" 
    }
]
~~~

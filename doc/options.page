# Page Server Options

When creating a Los Angeles page server, you pass it an "options" object that
controls certain aspects of its behaviour:

```
// Serve Los Angeles .page files
app.use(la.serve({
    contentPath: publicRoot
}).middleware)
```

The following describes these options.

## contentPath Property

The `contentPath` property specifies the base directory from which .page
files should be loaded.

This property is required.

## cache Property

This optional boolean property controls whether loaded .page files are cached.

If not specified, caching is enabled in production environments and disabled
in development environments.

The cache is a simple ever accumulating cache.  It never flushes itself and shouldn't
be blindly used on large content directories (as every page will eventually be loaded 
into memory).

To clear the cache, use the `clearCache()` method of the returned page server object:

```javascript
// Create page server
var pageServer = la.server({ 
    contentPath: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
    cache: true,
})

// Install middleware
app.use(pageServer.middleware)

.
.
.

// Somewhere else, perhaps on a scheduled task, clear the cache:
pageServer.clearCache();
```

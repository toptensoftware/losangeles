# Page File Format

Los Angeles .page files are simple text files that consist of a YAML front-matter
delimited by three hyphens before and after, followed by a plain text (typically
Markdown) body.

For example:

~~~
---
title: This is the YAML front matter
---
# This is a markdown heading

This is a markdown paragraph etc...
~~~


The front matter is optional, but is typically used to provide additional metadata
about the page that can be used by the view/layout rendering framework.

When Los Angeles loads a .page file, it combines the YAML front-matter properties,
the plain text body into a single JavaScript object.  It then adorns that object
with additional methods and properties as [described here](pageAdornments).

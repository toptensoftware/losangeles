# Special Front-Matter Properties

Some front-matter properties are considered special in that they control
Los Angeles' behaviour.

## view Property

The `view` property declares which Express view will be used to render the page.
If not specified, this property defaults to "page".

## layout Property

Although not explicitly handled by Los Angeles, some view engines (including
Handlebars and [Moe-js](/moe-js/)) use the `layout` property to specify the outer 
layout view into which the inner view should be rendered.

## externalBody Property

The `externalBody` property can be used to specify the URL of an external resource
that will be requested and appended to the end of the `rawBody`.

This provides an easy way to pull in content from other sources - eg: include the 
readme file of a git repository in your site.

## redirect Property

The `redirect` property causes this page to redirect to a different URL.

## isMarkdown Property

Setting this property to `false` disables the Markdown transformation of the page's
body, causing the `body` property to return the same value as the `rawBody` property.

## import Property

Specifies other .page files that this page should be merged over. This
property can be either a single filename, or an array of other files that will be 
merged in sequence.

eg: importing a single page:

~~~
import: myCommonSettings.page
~~~


eg: importing multiple pages:

~~~
import: 
  - myCommonSettings.page
  - myOtherCommonSettings.page
~~~

See [Imports and .commonPage](imports) for more.

## defaultSyntax Property

If specified, sets the default language for any Markdown code blocks that don't have
an explicit language specifier.

eg:

```Markdown
---
defaultSyntax: javascript
---
# Heading

~~~
// This code block will get class="language-javascript"
~~~

~~~csharp
// This code block will get class="language-csharp"
~~~

```

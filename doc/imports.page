# Imports and .common.page

Los Angeles provides two ways to declare common front-matter properties for
a set of pages:

## .common.page

Often it will be desirable to have a set of front-matter properties that are
common to every page in a folder.  These properties can be declared in the special
file `.common.page`.

When a .page file is loaded, if a .common.page file exists in the same folder it
is loaded first and the page being loaded is merged over the settings from .common.page.

eg: suppose you had a .common.page file like so...

~~~
---
projectName: "My Project"
---
~~~

... then every other .page file in that folder will also inherit the `projectName` setting
(unless it is overridden by a new setting in any of the page files).

## Imports

Besides this automatic importing of the .common.page file you can also explicitly import
other .page files with the `import` front-matter property in a page.  [See here](specialProperties#import-property).

The import property can also be used to import the .common.page file from a parent directory:

~~~
---
import: ../.common.page
---
~~~

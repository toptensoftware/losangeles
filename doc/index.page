# Welcome to Los Angeles

Los Angeles is a simple page content server for Node/Express that lets you
author markdown content as .page files with yaml "front matter" that is then
rendered via Express' view engine.

## Features

* Simple but powerful YAML front matter + Markdown page format
* Automatic import of common page settings
* User import of settings from other pages
* Also includes a simple url rewrite/redirect/proxy mapper
* Automatic image size calculation (including retina support)
* Caching of loaded pages

## Why is it called "Los Angeles"?

The name of this project comes from a personal habit of naming Node 
projects after songs by synth-wave bands.  This project is named after
the song [Los Angeles](https://open.spotify.com/track/4loXMor75kKVBB03ygwDlh?si=Iggn6ILiQ1aYe8TXoxWfyg)
by [The Midnight](https://www.themidnightofficial.com).
